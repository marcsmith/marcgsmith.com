I have 2 young <a href="http://www.marcgsmith.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/dkce.jpg">kids</a>, so it's a given we take a lot of pictures in my house.  Unfortunately i spend most of my weekdays at work away from them, but i'm thankful that my wife keeps me up to speed, emailing me pics here & there throughout the day.

I use gmail (you don't?  i'm sorry).  And i bounce between Safari & Chrome for exploring the web.  Every time i get an email from home with pic(s) of the kiddies in it, here's what i have to do....

I click 'View' (or 'View All' for multiple photos), and watch as my browser opens a new tab with the photos in it.

Sideways.

So annoying.
So what i generally do is drag the photo to my desktop, doubleclick it there, and check it out - in it's correct position - in Preview (my default on OSX).  Like i said, totally annoying for simply trying to view a pic of my 2 year old <a href="http://www.marcgsmith.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/dk_sunglasses.jpg">wearing mommy's sunglasses</a>.  And my desktop is constantly cluttered with these pics.

I'm not positive here, but this may just be related to sending pics with the iPhone (iPhone 4 in this case).  I don't seem to notice this happening when i get photos from other means.
I also notice when i upload iPhone photos to a site - such as this Wordpress site - the same is true, they are sideways.  :-/

Anyhow, i wrote a little <a href="http://marcsmith.github.com/#c_gmailPhotoRotate">Chrome extension</a> that will rotate the photo(s) so you don't have do what i do (well, used to do).  My desktop thanks me.
