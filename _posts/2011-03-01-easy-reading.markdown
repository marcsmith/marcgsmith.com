I listen to a lot of podcasts (maybe too many), and i'm a huge fan of <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/danbenjamin">Dan Benjamin</a>'s <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5by5</a> stuff.  <a href="http://5by5.tv/devshow">The Dev Show</a> - a show where he & co-host <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jseifer">Jason Seifer</a> provide useful development links from around the web - is what got me turned on to his stuff.  On the show, Dan occasionally mentions how sites with white text on black backgrounds are a bother.  I tend to agree (though probably to a much lesser extent), so i took it upon myself to mess around with writing Chrome & Safari extensions (maybe i'll write a FF one, too) to transform a "white text on black background" site (works for any site, really) to a "black text on white background" site.  I'm calling it "btowb" for obvious (=lame) reasons.

By no means is it exhaustive (i'm sure they could be improved upon), which is why they're up on github in case you were so inclined to fork.

I hope you enjoy!  Go <a href="http://marcsmith.github.com/">get</a> them.
